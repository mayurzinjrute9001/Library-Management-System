# Library-Management-System
I have created LMS, it has functionalities like user login, user can request books to read after requests are accepted by admin user can read that book till the end date and time. then there is functionality like if all the books are borrowed there user cant access books user will have to wait. after the expiry user have to send request again . 

*References - I got so much help from the chatgpt as for solving the errors that I can't solve and somethings I did'nt know like csv file download , some login required mixins, and advance django things
